# dotfiles
* getting ready to set up gnu stow instead of manual/scripted symlinks
* have two seperate styles of install.  
    * Common.d for basic apps and configs
    * i3-wm.d for use with i3-gaps as window manager

# Future work:
* store dotfiles in /bin.  does that make sense?

# Historical Versions:
* fix startScript to work on both apt and dnf systems.
